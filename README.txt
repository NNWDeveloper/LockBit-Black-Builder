LockBit Black Builder - LockBit Ransomware builder - Build your own ransomware. You can edit file named "config.json" and click on batch file "build.bat". If you will do this step by step in the folder will be your ransomware.

These two files are exactly the same, I've uploaded these files twice, because the other file has photos and pre-generated LockBit ransomware files in it. But it doesn't change the functionality, the two files work in exactly the same way.



HOW TO RUN IT?

	1. Edit the file named "config.json"
	2. Just run batch file named "build.bat"
	3. Open folder "Build"
	4. Find two files named "LB3" and "LB3Decryptor"
	5. This is all :-)
